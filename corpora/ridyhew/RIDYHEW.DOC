------------ Introduction

You think you know obscure English words? There are some in here that
you've never heard of, for sure. Extracted from gigabytes of documents from
around the World Wide Web. If you say RIDYHEW quickly, it sounds like
"really damn huge". And that's what it is.

------------ The RIDYHEW FAQ (acronym overload! Danger Will Robinson!)


 * So, uh, why?

Why does the sun shine? Why do the birds sing? Why do the voices keep
speaking in my head?

Seriously? For curiosity's sake, for playing word games and working 
crosswords, for reveling in the beautiful miracle of language.... if you 
have to ask. 

 * How many words are in RIDYHEW?

Right now, about 450,000. There are still a lot more words to find,
though. Must collect more words! More words!

 * What words are included in RIDYHEW? What words are excluded?

Words which are eligible for inclusion in RIDYHEW:

    - All common, uncapitalized nouns with plurals.
    - All verbs with all legal inflections (including archaic inflections,
        in the case of verbs current before the 18th century.) 
    - All adjectives with comparative and superlative (except in a case where 
        the comparative or superlative obviously does not apply.) 
    - All other parts of speech, with a minimum length of two letters. 
    - All spelling variants that can be well attested to in modern
        literature, including British and U.S. variants. 
    - Foreign words, if they have found widespread use in English. These
        words are usually included with their original plurals/inflections
        along with the Anglicized ones.     
    - Compound words, if they have found demonstrated use without a hyphen.
        Metric units with all legal prefixes and plurals. 

Words which are not eligible for inclusion in RIDYHEW:

    - Words that are generally found only capitalized: proper names,
        trademarks, etc. 
    - Contracted words, which are generally only found with an apostrophe. 
    - Compound words that are generally only found with a hyphen. 
    - Words of an over-specialized nature, for example, jargon from a small 
        profession or trade. 
    - Acronyms, except in the case where they have lost capitalization and are 
        used as ordinary words with parts of speech (snafu, awol for example) 
    - "Nonce" words, or words made up for an occasion which appear only a 
        handful of times in literature 
    - Foreign words which are rarely found in English literature or 
        conversation. 
    - Medical terms found only in Latin (with some exceptions.) 

Note that this list is not expurgated beyond the above, which means it
contains some pretty filthy and offensive words. Keep that in mind.

 * What are the terms of use?

Go ahead and use it in your commercial or non-commercial programming
projects. All I ask is that you redistribute the original documentation 
with RIDYHEW. 

 * How do you make the list?

First off, I used whatever public-domain word lists I could find off the 
Internet to form a base. Notice that a lot of these lists didn't fit the 
criteria I line out above, so they required extensive editing before I 
could add them to RIDYHEW. If you've never gone over 100,000+ words one by 
one looking for spelling errors and the like, well, you've simply never 
lived.

After that, what I did is I downloaded as many large text files, stories, 
Usenet postings, web pages, and Word documents that I could find, 
gigabytes of literature, extracted all of the words out of them, compared 
them to RIDYHEW and spat out whatever wasn't found. 

From there, I used automated tools to generate plurals for the nouns,
inflections for the verbs, comperative/superlative for the adjectives, 
etc. The words that were nonsense, misspelt, or otherwise ineligible for 
the RIDYHEW list I saved in a filter list, so I would never see them again 
in these output lists I edited. 

Words used in the works of Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Dickens, Twain,
Middleton, Alger, and many many others were reviewed in compiling the 
lists, thanks to Project Gutenberg (they rock!) Frequencygrams were 
created for unusual, uncommon and obsolete words used by the authors; 
these were used to eliminate obvious nonce words. 

I'm actually still going through these documents, and adding words to the
list. I'm also actively weeding out errors (there are some) from the 
RIDYHEW list.

 * So this list is being actively maintained?

Yes, it is, which makes it the longest such list available on the
Internet. (Actually it's one of the longest word lists, period, on the 
Internet.)

Updated versions are available on the Internet at
http://www.codehappy.net/wordlist.htm

I'm adding new words from a large number of sources, and removing the 
errors that have crept in. At the moment less than one-tenth of one 
percent is bad, which is a lot lot better than any other list you'll find 
this size. A lot more than 0.1% of the words are obscure, though, so be 
warned. (What, you didn't think a list with half a million different words 
wouldn't have some odd-balls? Hee-hee.) 

 * What lists are available?

Along with RIDYHEW, I have lists of given names (masculine and feminine),
lists of surnames, (the last two based on the U.S. Census lists), and a
long list of "never" words.

 * "Never" words?

Yep, "never" words. When I check a text document against the word
dictionary, I also check it against a list full of junk that I "never" 
want to see again in an output list. 

What you'd find in the "never" list:

   - A very large number of names (given names and surnames, from English and
        many other languages) 
   - Trademarks, of every different kind of thing you can imagine 
   - Names of cities, countries, rivers, counties, provinces, astronomical 
        landmarks, etc., etc. 
   - Proper nouns of miscellaneous classification 
   - All common misspellings of English words 
   - HTML tags, Javascript tokens, XML tags, etc. 
   - Keywords and common function calls in various programming languages 
   - Nonce and non-words 
   - Words without parts of speech 
   - Thousands upon thousands of acronyms 
   - Excessively technical or jargony words 
   - Foreign words of all sort and description 
   - File extensions, user names, handles, words run together, etc. 
   - Any manner of assorted weird junk! 

Compiled from gigabytes upon gigabytes of text files, Usenet messages, web
      pages, etc.

<My apologies for some of this source code. It's not commented,
it wasn't meant for general consumption, and was written in a hurry.
But if it's useful for you, great.>

nojunk.c        Used to remove non-alphabetic characters from text files
dictpar.c       Used to parse the public domain 1913 Webster's for goodies
nodefs.c        Used to strip everything but the first word on a line
split.c         Used to split a text file into two smaller files, on a line
distrib.cxx     Shows the distribution of words (by first letter, length)
                        and other interesting statistics
encodel.cxx     Used to compress the dictionary (needs dict.cxx)
dict.cxx        Implements a fancy-pants dictionary tree
issort.cxx      Checks to see whether a text file is sorted
makeweb.cxx     Creates a series of web pages listing all of the words
                        in the RIDYHEW list, highlighted according to

                or pluralization of English words. Gets most of them right
                and saves a lot of time in going through lists containing
                thousands and thousands of words.
units.cxx       Create all of the legal metric units from the base units,
                appending prefices and plurals.
